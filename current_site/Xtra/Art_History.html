         <h1>Art History</h1>
         <p>
The art history area in the Department of Art & Design at UWEC offers over twenty courses in the discipline. Its curriculum encompasses a broad scope of coursework study over a wide array of time periods, cultures, and geographical regions. Courses range from medieval art to the art of Tawantinsuyo, from the ancient art and architecture of Mexico and Central America to the history of 20th-century art, from the study of ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman art to themes in contemporary art. It also offers separate courses in the histories of photography, world architecture, and graphic design. Art history course offerings support the majors in American Indian Studies and Latin American Studies. Art history courses involve slide lecture-discussion, tests, research essays, group projects, and class participation. Art history faculty participate in field trips to Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York City, and in field study opportunities in various cities abroad. The art history area fully participates in the General Education program at UW-Eau Claire, and fully supports the Liberal Education Learning Goals. 
<p>
The Department of Art & Design offers a <strong>major in art history</strong> under the 36-credit BA/BS degree MAJOR: ART, Liberal Arts, Art History Emphasis (code: 020-209), in addition to the 24-credit Liberal Arts minor program in art history (code: 030-401). The art history area expects its graduating majors or minors to be well prepared, highly knowledgeable, and broadly educated through art history coursework, in order to pursue a variety of post-baccalaureate options in art history. These options would include a masterâ€™s degree in art history, museum or curatorial employment, or studies in art conservation, etc.
